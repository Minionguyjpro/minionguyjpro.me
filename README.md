# Minionguyjpro! ðŸŽˆ
Hello there! I am a teenager who loves computing. I started developing, tinkering with computers, upgrading computers (building a PC is a future plan). I also started writing a book called ``The Computing Guy: A Story of Knowledge`` and I love it! I am also creating ideas in a book, which I share with y'all in the repository you can find by clicking [here](https://github.com/Minionguyjpro/Brain-Diggin). If I wouldn't become software engineer then I'd become architect, inventer, engineer in general, book writer or something else that I'd love.
